# Hangman
Introduction

This Hangman game is a simple, text-based implementation of the classic word-guessing game. Players are presented with a hidden word, and they must guess one letter at a time to reveal the word. The game continues until the player guesses the word correctly or runs out of guesses.

Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the following parameters in the hangman.py file:

word_list: You can change the list of words that the game randomly selects from.
max_attempts: Adjust the maximum number of attempts allowed for each round.
